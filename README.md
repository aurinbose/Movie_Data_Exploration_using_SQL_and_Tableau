# Movie-Data-Exploration

This is an exploration of a sample movie dataset obtained during the course of completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. Howerver this exploration is done independently and not as part of the coursework. This analysis was performed because I thought the dataset had interesting insights to provide. 
The dataset contains information about Movie titles, Release Date, Genre, Directors, Cast, Budget and Box office Revenue for movies between 2012 and 2016. 

The scenario I imagined was: What if I was a movie studio and wanted to make a movie that almost guaranteed Profits on my Investments? To this end I was able to create dashboard visualizations that showed exactly what director, actor, genre and release month combination would most likely generate the most revenue based on past trends as well as extract useful metrics through SQL queries.
